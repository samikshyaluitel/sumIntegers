# sumIntegers

You are given two arbitrarily numbers, stored one digit at a time in a slice.

The first must be added to the second, and the second must be reversed before addition. 

The goal is to calculate the sum of those two sets of values. 

Sample Inputs: 
num of digit in first input = 6 
num of digit in second input = 6

num1 = 123456 
num2 = 123456 

Sample Output: 
Result: 777777
